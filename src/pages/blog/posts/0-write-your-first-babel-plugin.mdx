Babel is an extremely powerful tool in frontend tooling. Chances are you will
[find the plugin you need on **npm**](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=babel%20plugin),
but what about when you need something novel?

## Use cases

- Adding transformations to personal TypeScript/JavaScript libraries
- Automating test cases or mocks
- Simple codemods

## Learn these terms

- [**AST**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree): Source code abstracted as a JavaScript object. When Babel parses code, it
  transforms it into this.
- **Nodes**: These are objects representing specific [Babel types](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-types)
  in the AST
- **Paths**: These are objects that link nodes to one another in the AST
- [**Visitor**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern): Visitors
  allow you to perform operations on specific paths in the AST based on
  their type

## Treat yourself

- Do yourself a favor and prefer TypeScript to JavaScript when writing your plugin.
- Type guards (e.g. `t.isObjectProperty(path)`) in `@babel/types` create a flawless autocomplete
  experience and result in more resilient plugins.

## Libraries you'll need

- [**@babel/core**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@babel/core): Parse source code into an AST and transform it.
  In particular, see the `parseAsync()` and `transformAsync()` API references.
- [**@babel/types**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@babel/types): Check node types and construct new AST nodes.
- [**@babel/generator**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@babel/generator): Generate source code from an AST.
- [**@babel/template**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@babel/template): Build an AST from strings and placeholders
  rather than the utility functions in `@babel/types`.
- [**@babel/helper-plugin-utils**](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/next/babel-helper-plugin-utils.html): Provide clear messages
  to your plugin users if their Babel version doesn't have APIs required by your plugin.
- [**babel-plugin-tester**](https://github.com/babel-utils/babel-plugin-tester): The easiest way to test your babel plugin.

## Resources

- [**Babel Plugin Handbook**](https://github.com/kentcdodds/babel-plugin-handbook/blob/master/README.md#table-of-contents): Go
  deeper into Babel plugin concepts.
- [**Babel Types**](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-types): Quickly search for the AST
  node types you're looking for.
- [**Babel Plugin Macros**](https://github.com/kentcdodds/babel-plugin-macros): Allow
  plugin users to utilize your plugin transformations without adding it to their
  Babel config. This is useful for libraries like [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
  that don't allow you to customize your plugins.

## Finding examples

- The best place to find example plugins is the [Babel monorepo](https://github.com/babel/babel/tree/eea156b2cb8deecfcf82d52aa1b71ba4995c7d68/packages)
  itself. This seems obvious, but it hid in plain sight for me for some time.
- I have found the most basic plugins to be the most useful for understanding how to write one.

## Anatomy of a plugin

This is a contrived example of a Babel plugin that hoists all duplicate `StringLiteral` types to
a higher scope. In the real world more nuanced logic is required to avoid replacing object
property keys and mutable strings willy-nilly.

** What you're going to see**

- Plugin options, state
- A few built-in plugin utilities
- What `enter()` and `exit()` visitors look like

```ts
import * as t from '@babel/types'
import * as babel from '@babel/core'

export default function babelPluginHoistCommonStrings() {
  return {
    // This provides the user with better error messages if
    // our plugin throws
    name: 'hoist-common-strings',
    // And here is the meat of your plugin - the visitor
    visitor: {
      /**
       * @param path This is the Path we talked about above. It
       *  is an object that links Nodes together.
       * @param state An object that contains a bunch of metadata
       *  about the ... state ... of the transformation. Here you'll find:
       *    - state.ast: The current AST from its root Node
       *    - state.code: The code string being transformed
       *    - state.opts: Plugin options
       *    - state.cwd: The working directory of the user
       *    - state.filename: The absolute filename of file
       *      currently being transformed
       */
      StringLiteral(path: babel.NodePath<t.StringLiteral>, state: any) {
        // state.opts give us access to options specific to this plugin
        // provided by the user with ['hoist-common-strings', {...options...}]
        const {minLen = 2} = state.opts

        // Here we're going to add the paths for each string literal that
        // was used to our state. This will allow us to count them later
        // and make sure our `minUses` option was surpassed.
        const {node} = path
        state.commonStrings = state.commonStrings || {}
        const {commonStrings} = state
        // Only hoist strings that surpass our minimum length
        if (node.value.length >= minLen) {
          commonStrings[node.value] = commonStrings[node.value] || []
          commonStrings[node.value].push(path)
        }
      },
      // Program is at the root of the AST
      Program: {
        /**
         * This is a method on our visitor that is going to be
         * called right before the visitor exits the node.
         */
        exit(path: babel.NodePath<t.Program>, state: any) {
          // state.opts give us access to options specific to this plugin
          // provided by the user with ['hoist-common-strings', {...options...}]
          const {minUses = 1} = state.opts
          // These are the strings we found matching our criteria
          const {commonStrings} = state

          for (const string in commonStrings) {
            const paths = commonStrings[string]
            // This ensures we only hoist common strings that are used
            // more than the user's `minUses` option
            if (paths.length > minUses) {
              // Babel has some greate utilities that come with
              // each plugin. To cover them all in one post
              // would be impossible.
              //
              // This helper will create a unique Identifier node
              // specific to this string
              const id = path.scope.generateUidIdentifier(string)
              // Here we replace each of our string paths with the Identifier
              // returned above
              paths.forEach((stringPath: babel.NodePath<t.StringLiteral>) => {
                stringPath.replaceWith(id)
              })
              // Finally, we add our Identifier into AST
              path.scope.push({id, init: t.stringLiteral(string)})
            }
          }
        },
      },
    },
  }
}
```

Given the input:

```js
const MyObject = {
  hello: 'world',
  hello1: 'world',
  hello2: 'world',
  a: 'a',
  a1: 'a',
  a2: 'a',
}
```

We expect the output:

```js
var _world = 'world'
const MyObject = {
  hello: _world,
  hello1: _world,
  hello2: _world,
  a: 'a',
  a1: 'a',
  a2: 'a',
}
```
