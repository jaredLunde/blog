**Irrational beings.** We spend countless hours unleashing every opinion we have to other people.
All the while, we judge every opinion we hear. We rate their significance. We ask "Should I trust
this person?". Sometimes we don't think at all. We just accept an opinion as true, based on its
source or our own beliefs.

**Truth is contextual.** Time is a destructor of opinions. Entropy will kick their asses.
In your best case scenario, one in which you are "100% correct" in a moment, you may be wrong
in the next. In your worst case scenario, one in which you are "100% wrong" in a moment, you
may be right in the next.

**Truths are in constant competition.** Between individual perceptions and economics, no truth
is safe. Your opinion, correct in most merits, may be outcompeted by less-merited opinions
that are more viral. Some combination of the [availability heuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic)
and the [backfire effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias#backfire_effect) will beat
your opinion before it even gets off the ground.

**Opinions are far from worthless.** They shape who we are, what we do, and how we feel.
Shape-shifters who can skillfully model their world earn great social and economic rewards
for being correct more often. Or for longer periods of time. For that reason, it is important
to know when to let go of your opinion.

**Let it go.** Because an opinion can only correct for a period of time or in a certain context,
the rational approach is to drop your attachment. Sounds easy enough, right? But it's not. Most
of us are terrible at separating our _self_ from what we hold true. But it's the only way to be
free of any ego that is holding us back.

**Remember to forget.** You are unlikely to be the only conscious being with opinions. Solipsism
aside, there's an entire world around you making interpretations of its own perpetual space. A
world that is going to change its own opinions and actions as it receives information. Be kind to
this world. Give it the grace you desire for yourself when you are less correct. And learn from it,
adjust your [priors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_probability) to their perceivingly
warranted degree.

**This feels right, right now.** I will not pretend this is an original piece. William James,
quoted above, has entire essays on truth and process philosophy - essays that are certainly worth
more of your time than this. Humans have grappled with the issues of truth and opinion since the
beginning of conscious thought. In my own perceptual space, at this point in time, William James
seems correct to me. But I could be wrong. Or it could not matter. And that is the point.

**So please, I beg you.** Forget what I said. Allow me to shape-shift. I promise I will
do the same for you.
