If you can view this blog post right now you've got a front row seat to the
future of the web. I launched this blog without using a bundler like Webpack,
Rollup, or Parcel.

## Here's why

1. [ES modules have broad support](https://caniuse.com/#feat=es6-module)
2. [So does dynamic `import()`](https://caniuse.com/#search=dynamic%20import)
3. [IE11 is almost dead](https://death-to-ie11.com/) and apps like YouTube and Gmail no
   longer support it
4. 1-3 aside, I assume my audience is technical

## The case for [Snowpack](https://snowpack.dev)

**Wise guys**: Snowpack markets itself as a development tool that you can hook your
favorite bundler up to in production. It's a smart move that will earn them the highest
adoption rate.

**The big picture**: Snowpack also optimizes production builds itself. It can accomplish
nearly as much as Webpack, Parcel, et. al. I should know - [I am writing a bunch of plugins](https://github.com/jaredLunde?tab=repositories&q=snowpack-plugin&type=&language=).

### Why I am bullish

1. [**üî• Active development**](https://github.com/pikapkg/snowpack/commits/master): Snowpack is
   acquiring features at a clip.
2. **üè≠ Production-ready**: Unlike [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite), Snowpack is capable of producing
   production-optimized ES module builds without a bundler. Vite uses
   [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/) for production builds and is itself just a
   fast development server.
3. **„∏ö All-in on web modules**: It's made by those who brought us [Skypack](https://www.skypack.dev/)
4. **‚ö° Optimized for speed**: Snowpack builds leverage HTTP/2 and HTTP/3. As a result, your app will
   download in parallel. Snowpack also code splits, minifies, and treeshakes - better than
   bundlers do.

### Reasons to be bearish

1. You (currently) can&apos;t accomplish server-side rendering without a bundler. Your app will
   have to be rendered client-side if you use Snowpack by itself. I have some ideas about solving
   this.
